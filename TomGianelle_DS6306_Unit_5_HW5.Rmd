## R Markdown

## Q1

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r 1a, echo=TRUE}
##1a - read in ; delimited txt file containing baby names, gender and amount of children named in 2016
setwd("~/Documents/SMU/Doing DS/datasets")
df <- read.delim("yob2016.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ";", fill = TRUE)
col_headings <- c("FirstName", "Gender", "AmountofChildren")
names(df) <-col_headings
```

```{r 1b, echo=TRUE}
##1b -- summary and structure of df
dim(df)
summary(df$AmountofChildren)

```

```{r 1c 1d, echo=TRUE}
##1c -- three y’s at the end of the name.  Write an R command to figure out which name it is and display it.   Remove the row with the yyy
print(df$FirstName[grep("yyy", df$FirstName)])
y2016 <- df[-grep("yyy", df$FirstName),]
```
## Q2

Utilize yob2015.txt for this question.  This file is similar to yob2016, but contains names, gender, and total children given that name for the year 2015.

```{r 2a, echo=TRUE}
##2a - read in ; delimited txt file containing baby names, gender and amount of children named in 2016
setwd("~/Documents/SMU/Doing DS/datasets")
y2015 <- read.delim("yob2015.txt", header = FALSE, sep = ",", fill = TRUE)
col_headings <- c("FirstName", "Gender", "AmountofChildren")
names(y2015) <-col_headings
```

```{r 2b, echo=TRUE}
##2b -- 	Display the last ten rows in the dataframe.  Describe something you find interesting about these 10 rows
tail(y2015, n=10)

```
##Observation --- They are all boy's names

```{r 2c, echo=TRUE}
##2c -- Merge y2016 and y2015 by your Name column; assign it to final.  The client only cares about names that have data for both 2016 and 2015; there should be no NA values in either of your amount of children rows after merging
final <- merge( x = y2015, y = y2016, by = "FirstName", na.rm = TRUE)

```

## Q3
```{r 3a, echo=TRUE}
##3a -- Create a new column called “Total” in final that adds the amount of children in 2015 and 2016 together.  In those two years combined, how many people were given popular names?
final <- data.frame(final, as.numeric(final$AmountofChildren.x) + as.numeric(final$AmountofChildren.y))
col_headings <- c("FirstName", "Gender2015", "AmtofChildren2015", "Gender2016", "AmtofChildren2016", "Total")
names(final) <- col_headings
```
##Total # of babies with popular names
```{r 3a sum, echo=TRUE}
sum(final$Total)
```

```{r 3b, echo=TRUE}
##3b -- Sort the data by Total.  What are the top 10 most popular names?
final <- final[order(final$Total),]
```
##Top 10 baby names
```{r 3b display, echo=TRUE}
tail(final, n=10)
```
```{r 3c, echo=TRUE}
##3c -- Omit boys and give the top 10 most popular girl’s names.
female <- final[(final$Gender2015=="F"),]

```

##Top 10 female baby names
```{r 3c display, echo=TRUE}
female <- female[order(female$Total),]
tail(female$FirstName, n=10)
```
```{r 3d, echo=TRUE}
##3d -- Write these top 10 girl names and their Totals to a CSV file.  Leave out the other columns entirely.
female <- female[order(female$Total),]
name <- tail(female$FirstName, n=10)
total <- tail(female$Total, n=10)
df <- data.frame(name, total)
df <- df[order(-df$total),]
write.csv(df, file="top10femalebabynames.csv")

```
